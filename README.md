# QAOA_qiskit
In this repository, I will summarize my understanding of QAOA. Furthermore, using Qiskit I will try to solve a classical Ising model in one dimension with periodic boundary condition.

In the [AFM notebook](https://github.com/animeshnanda1/QAOA/blob/main/qaoa_afm_ising_1d.ipynb) and [FM Notebook](https://github.com/animeshnanda1/QAOA/blob/main/qaoa_fm_ising_1d.ipynb), I will solve the anti-ferromagnetic and ferromagnetic Ising model respectively.

The idea for both the work is very similar, and they are inspired by [this lecture video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Sos_lR-kI&t=1077s&ab_channel=RuslanShaydulinRuslanShaydulin).
