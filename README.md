# QAOA
In this repository I will summarize my understanding of QAOA. Furthermore, using qiskit I will try to solve a calssical Ising model in one dimension with periodic boundary condition.

In the [AFM notebook](https://github.com/animeshnanda1/QAOA/blob/main/qaoa_afm_ising_1d.ipynb) and [FM Notebook](https://github.com/animeshnanda1/QAOA/blob/main/qaoa_fm_ising_1d.ipynb), I will solve the anti-ferromagnetic and ferromagnetic Ising model respectively.
